# Airbnb-Rental-Price-Prediction:
----
The objective of this project was to model the rental prices for Airbnb apartments in London.

# Problem Statement:
----
* Airbnb is an online marketplace which allows users to post lisings on their website and it earns commissions from every booking.
* At present when someone wants to list an Airbnb rental, they have to manually analyze similar properties near their location and decide the price themselves.
* Idea of our project is to form a model to estimate what the correct price of their rental should be given the features of their property.

# Dataset:
----
* Rows: 77000+ 
* Columns: 97
